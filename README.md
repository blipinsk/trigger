# DEPRECATED

This is pretty much useless, when we have lambdas.

No new development will be taking place. This library will not be maintained.

Thanks for all the support!!!

## Trigger

Simple command pattern helper class.

Let's be honest... that's just a simple class, but it can sometimes tidy up your code quite a bit. It uses java generics and intuitive class naming, so you can easily create a method reference or just a callback, just like you wanted.

## Usage

Check [USAGE.md](USAGE.md)
